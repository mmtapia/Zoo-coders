  <p>A lot of people just go tozoos cause they want to see new animals. What they don't know is that
  these zoos are mistreating those animals in very terrible ways. To help you know what zoos actually
  do to animals, we've come up with this list of the horrific ways that zoos treat the animals that they 
  keep captive.</p>
  
  <ol>
	<li>The living conditions of the animals are not monitored very well.</li>
	<p>When someone reads this they might think that the zoos they go to have amazing habitats for the
	animals to live in. Those people probably have never been to a roadside zoo. These zoos don't have 
	elaborate enclosures where the animals can feel in the wild. These enclosures at roadside zoos are 
	basically cages with a concrete floor, only big enough for the animals to stand up, walk around a 
	little, and lie down. The attributes of the cages are actually "fine"; the Animal Welfare Act only 
	provides that animals have this sort of enclosure and inspectors only come to roadside zoos once a 
	year. 
	</p>
	<li>Animals in captivity can be driven crazy</li>
	<p>If someone were to go to a zoo, they might notice that some of the animals might be pacing, 
	circling around or doing other repetativeactions. These types of behavoirs are symptoms for a conditon
	called "zoochosis." They begin to suffer from this condition because of severe psychic siffering. Many
	times zoos try to cover this up by giving the animals antidepresents or mood stabilizers like Prozac. 
	Lonliness, frustration, and their small enclosures can all lead to zoochsis.  </p>
