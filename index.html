	<h2>About Us</h2>
	
	<p>We are two new coders trying to advocate for animals welfare in zoos. Together we would like to make a difference 
	big or small. Our inspriration was the PETA foundation and how they've been able to spread awareness. We want to 
	highlight animal cruelty that's happening from all over. We feel that this topic is not shared enough. Creating our 
	wed site we are helping increase awarenees on such a serious topic.
