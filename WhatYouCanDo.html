	<h1>What you can do to help with this problem.</h1>
    <p>Because this is such a big problem, we've come up with some ways that you—or 
	any one else—can do inorder to help prevent further animal abuse.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Visit animal sanctuaries instead of zoos.</li>
    <p>Animals in sanctuaries are treated better than in zoos. Instead of having the
	animals to sell tickets, they are there to have a safe place to live when they 
	are recovering form an injury</p>
